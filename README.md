# Project Zero

A third-person medieval online-game.

Powered by blender, babylon.js, npm and github.

All assets created by my own - expect the current background song that was donated for that game :).

Basic Texture Sets used in the assets might refer to https://texturehaven.com/textures/.
**Please consider to support Robs' awesome work!**

Inspired by the awesome 'Sketchbook' Project made by swift502 (https://github.com/swift502/Sketchbook).
